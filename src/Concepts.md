## Data Structure and Algorithm Concepts

### HashMaps
Being able to retrieve any value in a list in constant time. Can be used to drastically speed up your algorithm.

### Recursion
Being able to traverse a tree/graphandtree recursively. Calling same algorithm (function) again with changed parameters.

Use backtracking to go back to previous nodes in the graphandtree/tree if the end selection of the current iteration isn't the expected result. 

Use dynamic programming to build up your solutions from your previous solution. For example, fibonacci number, f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2).

### DFS & BFS
DFS will search until the left most node and then go back to search its sibling nodes. Recursion is better for doing DFS.

BFS will search for all the children nodes and then go to its grand children nodes. Iteration with queue to hold the child nodes works to do BFS.

### Binary Search
Given a sorted array, find the mid-point and then search on one side of the list depending on some condition. 
You can find the mid-point of a linked nodes by have two pointers, with one pointer iterating twice as fast as the other.  

### Sliding Window
It's a concept that requires two pointers with each iterating from opposite sides of the list. 
It can improve the efficiency of the algorithm for applicable problems to O(n). 

### Heaps
Min and Max heaps can be generated by using PriorityQueue.
